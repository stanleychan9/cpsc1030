                        <p>Although Wong Tai Sin is an old district, its urban planning is not as poor as other old areas in Hong Kong. There are quite a number of recreational and cultural facilities for residents here to spend their leisure time.</p>

                        <p><a href="http://www.wongtaisintemple.org.hk/en/index" target="_blank">Wong Tai Sin Temple</a><img src="../mainimages/externallink.png" width="16" height="16" alt="external link" class="extlink"> is a landmark Taoist temple in Wong Tai Sin district for worshipping "Wong Tai Sin" (meaning of the Great Immortal Wong) built in 1921. However, on top of the Taoist elements, there are also Confucian and Buddhist components in the temple. The temple is administered by <a href="https://www2.siksikyuen.org.hk/en/index" target="_blank">Sik Sik Yuen</a><img src="../mainimages/externallink.png" width="16" height="16" alt="external link" class="extlink">, a religious charity group in Hong Kong established when Wong Tai Sin Temple was built.</p>
                        <p>The temple is located just next to Wong Tai Sin MTR station. Perhaps due to its convenience, it attracts many people to visit especially in the Chinese New Year for good fortune in the new year. In particular, a big crowd waited to offer the "first incense" to the "gods" inside the temple at the time when the new year comes.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/parks/mp/index.html" target="_blank">Morse Park</a><img src="../mainimages/externallink.png" width="16" height="16" alt="external link" class="extlink"> is one of the major public parks in the Wong Tai Sin district. It consists of four separate parks, an indoor sports center and several swimming pools. There are numerous fields for basketball and football (OKAY, it is called soccer in North America!). The park is close to both Wong Tai Sin and Lok Fu MTR stations.</p>
                        <p>Morse Park was involved in Hong Kong politics! Police bribery was very serious in Hong Kong. The grievances heightened in 1973 when Peter Godber, a chief superintendent fled to the UK when he faced bribery accusations. Mass protests, illegal and rarely seen at that time, were held and one of them was in Morse Park. The <a href="https://www.icac.org.hk/" target="_blank">Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC)</a><img src="../mainimages/externallink.png" width="16" height="16" alt="external link" class="extlink"> was eventually set up in 1974 to combat corruptions.</p>

The park is near Chuk Yuen area of the district. There are simple playground facilities, but most people go there for a barbecue.</p>
                        <p>Do not mix the park with <a href="https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/country/cou_vis/cou_vis_cou/cou_vis_cou_lr/cou_vis_cou_lr.html" target="_blank">Lion Rock Country Park</a><img src="../mainimages/externallink.png" width="16" height="16" alt="external link" class="extlink">, which is managed under a stricter set of laws (for environmental conservation) and a different government department! Lion Rock Park is just next to this country park, where people can enjoy hiking - many like to walk across the mountain from Wong Tai Sin to Shatin, another district in the New Territories of Hong Kong.</p>
