                        <h2>History of Wong Tai Sin</h2>
                        <p>Wong Tai Sin is an area with human activities as early as the 18th century. This page focuses on the development of the district after the Second World War, which ended in 1945.</p>

                        <p>In fact, the development of Wong Tai Sin is much related to the post-war history of Hong Kong at large!</p>

                        <p>Although WWII ended in the mid-1940s, a civil war between the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continued in China, which is at the north of Hong Kong. </p>
                        <p>To flee from war-zones and the communist rule after the victory of CCP in 1949, many Chinese people came to Hong Kong. Wong Tai Sin was one of their settlement areas and they built numerous squatter huts to stay in the district.</p>

                        <p>With the population boom caused by inflow of Chinese refugees, the Hong Kong government started to construct larger-scale public housing estates in different areas in Hong Kong, including Wong Tai Sin.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, light industry in Hong Kong started to develop rapidly. It was fuelled by some Chinese industrialists who brought their capital to Hong Kong for re-establishment of their factories near residential areas like Wong Tai Sin.</p>

                        <p>Hong Kong was hit by pro-communist riots in 1967. The poor livelihood of factory workers in Hong Kong also contributed to the political instability. In fact, the riots were sparked by labour exploitation in a plastic factory in Wong Tai Sin in April.</p>
                        <!-- Ref: https://www.ln.edu.hk/mcsln/archive/27th_issue/pdf/feature_01.pdf -->
                        <p>While the riots died down in late-1967 partly due to the public's dissatisfaction over the leftists, the Hong Kong government took the opportunity to review its governance. Greater efforts in social policies in Hong Kong were observed afterward.</p>

                        <p>Lion Rock, which occupies part of Wong Tai Sin, is one of the mountains in Hong Kong and it is famous of its mountain top like a lion head. In the 1970s, public broadcastor RTHK started to broadcast a situational TV drama series <span class="drama">Below the Lion Rock</span>, which focused on stories surrounding a family in Wang Tau Hom.</p>
                        <p>The drama is believed to be reflecting the typical life of many grassroots Hongkongers at that time, which was difficult but people still worked hard to overcome it.</p>

                        <p>Manufacturing industry in Hong Kong started to decline in the 1980s due to increasing cost and availability of opportunities in China since the opening up policy there. Many factories, including those in Wong Tai Sin, moved from Hong Kong to southern cities in China like Shenzhen and Zhuhai.</p>
                        <p>Like other districts in Hong Kong, many factory buildings in Wong Tai Sin have been vacanted or redeveloped to commerial buildings to cater the rise of service sector.</p>
